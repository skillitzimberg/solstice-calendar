# Solstice-based Calendar

## Why

I'm not much a fan of religion, so Christmas doesn't mean anything to me. However, my favorite time of the year is mid- to late spring leading up to the Northern hemisphere's estival (summer) solstice, the longest day of the year.

This is a near total personal re-definition of the calendar. Solstices and equinoxes have long been points of celebration for many cultures, which in my mind makes them more important than specific religious celebrations. Again, totally my perspective and I am a total xenophile and love whatever you're into.

# What

I'm starting out just making a normal calendar with React. Once I have that I'll make the time shift. To explore SOA I might move the date calculations into a Golang service.
